# Machine Learning in the Housing Market
  Daisy K. Miguel G. and Vandrea F.

#Summary


In this project we did a deeper dive into how machine learning can be used in the housing market. 

The raw dataset used was; Housing.csv which we retrieve from Kaggle.com, in which was a California census data collected in 1990. 

In order to prepare the data to properly test machine learning models "One-Hot Encoding" and "Train-Test Split" was used to clean the csv dataset. By employing One-Hot Encoding, we've made our categorical data machine-friendly, and through Train-Test Split, we've set the stage for model evaluation. 


In doing so the machine learning models we used were: Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor,K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor and Random Forest Regressor. We found the most success with  the Random Forest Regressor with an R-squared value of 0.8173290384570426. Which can be viewed in the Project_4_Housing.ipynb file.

In the Map.twbx file, a deeper look into the dataset can be viewed to analyze the raw dataset from a graphical view point.

In conclusion we found that machine learning can help investors, new home buyers, realtors and many more in the future to predict the best time to buy or sell or even speculate if a home is being overpriced or underappreciated.

To view the final product you may view it in the Housing Market.pptx file.
